# Centralia Visualization
Rasberry Pi and NeoPixel codes for Centralia. 

We helped a team from Penn State University to visualize data on off-gases coming out mines in Centralia. The final product is a led display with custom wiring which was displayed in their gallery, 
Codes in the Repo are all Rasberry PI codes.
